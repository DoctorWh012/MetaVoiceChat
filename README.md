&ast; Currently, only Mirror is supported, however other libraries can easily be implemented by composing an agnostic MonoBehaviour and implementing a minimal interface â€” please feel free to contribute additional network provider implementations. Please make PRs with any of your changes or improvements if you feel they would be helpful to the public. Please create issues for things as you see fit.

## <b>Notice for Unity versions 2021 and older!!!</b>
- For older versions of Unity that do not include the System.Memory namespace, you must use [the legacy branch of MetaVoiceChat](https://github.com/Metater/MetaVoiceChat/tree/legacy).
- Unity made this change somewhere in the 2021 versions of Unity.
- If you are using 2021, try the main branch first, but if you get errors, use the legacy branch.
- If you are using 2020 or earlier, use the legacy branch.

## Installation
1. On this page, click "<> Code" -> "Download ZIP".
2. Unzip the ZIP into your Unity "Assets" folder.
    - The "MetaVoiceChat" folder can be moved to anywhere inside of "Assets".
    - Delete ".gitattributes" and ".gitignore" to ensure the "MetaVoiceChat folder works correctly with your source control.
3. See [Tutorial](#tutorial) for additional steps.

## Tutorial
1. Ensure you have properly completed the [installation](#installation) steps.
2. Create a "Voice Chat" or similarly named game object as a child of your networked player game object or other networked game object that you would like to have networked audio on.
3. Add the "MetaVc" component to the "Voice Chat" game object.
4. Add your desired audio input, such as "VcMicAudioInput" to the game object.
5. Likewise, add your desired audio output, such as "VcAudioSourceOutput" to the game object.
6. Connect your audio input and output to the "MetaVc" fields.
7. Lastly, add your desired network provider, such as "MirrorNetProvider" to the game object.
8. It should look something like this now: ![TutorialA](Images/TutorialA.png)
    - All of these defaults should be okay, however you may want to decrease the "Complexity" field for games with many concurrently connected users or lower-end devices.
    - Remember to use "Max Codec Milliseconds" to ensure that your complexity value is not too high for your game.
        - Note: The codec performs sluggishly in bursts, so set this value higher than your desired frame period and ensure warnings are not being spammed and then increase it back to the max to disable it when you are done testing.
    - Use "Allow Multiple Codec Warnings Per Frame" to ensure you get the total frame time used by the codec when there are warnings.
9. Create a "Voice Chat Output" or similarly named Audio Source game object as a child of the networked game object. If this is a player, it should be in the mouth area.
10. Configure the output Audio Source
    - "Output" = the voice chat audio mixer group (optional)
    - "Play On Awake" = false
    - "Loop" is set to true internally, so don't worry
    - "Spacial Blend" = 1 for 3D proximity chat and 0 for normal voice chat
    - "3D Sound Settings"
        - "Doppler Level" is set to 0 internally, so don't worry (It must be 0 because of how Unity implements this)
        - "Max Distance" = ~50 meters or whatever you think is best
        - Ensure the volume roll-off curve's last data point has a volume of zero.
    - Your general settings should look like this: ![TutorialB](Images/TutorialB.png)
    - Your 3D sound settings should look like this: ![TutorialC](Images/TutorialC.png)
11. Connect your voice chat output Audio Source to the "Audio Source" field under the "Vc Audio Source Output" component.
12. Connect the "Meta Vc" fields under your audio input and output to the "Meta Vc" sibling component.
13. At this point, the "Voice Chat" game object should look like this: ![TutorialD](Images/TutorialD.png)
14. You are done!!! See [tips](#tips) below for more.

## Tips
- Change Project Settings/Audio/DSP Buffer Size from "Best performance" to "Best latency"
- Apply input and output filters to audio inputs and outputs by using the first filter fields
- Chain together input and output filters to form pipelines by using the next filter fields
- A frame size of 10 ms is useful for achieving lower latency on higher-end devices with high network send rates for all users. A frame size of 40 ms is useful for optimization on lower-end devices and networks, but this negatively impacts ear-to-ear latency and worsens the audio quality when packets are dropped. A frame size of 20 ms is a good balance.

## Public APIs
```cs
public class VcMic : IDisposable
{
    public bool IsRecording { get; }
    public AudioClip AudioClip { get; }
    public IReadOnlyList<string> Devices { get; }
    public int CurrentDeviceIndex { get; }
    public int CurrentDeviceName { get; }

    // zero-based frame index, samples
    public event Action<int, float[]> OnFrameReady;

    public void SetDeviceIndex(int index) { }
    public void StartRecording() { }
    public void StopRecording() { }
    public void Dispose() { }
}
```

## Extending Functionality

### How do I write a network provider implementation?
- TODO

### How do I write a VcAudioInput?
- Ideas for you: transmit an audio file or in-game audio
- TODO

### How do I write a VcAudioOutput?
- Ideas for you: save audio or do speech-to-text
- TODO

### How do I write a VcInputFilter?
- TODO

### How do I write a VcOutputFilter?
- TODO

## Community Questions
- Should code fail without throwing exceptions? Should silent failure be an option? E.g. VcMicAudioInput and VcAudioClip may throw.
- How can vulnerabilities be found and compensated for?

## Games Made with MetaVoiceChat
- My own WIP game "Bomb Bois". I am still getting the public Steam page up.

&ast; Currently, only Mirror is supported, however other libraries can easily be implemented by composing an agnostic MonoBehaviour and implementing a minimal interface â€” please feel free to contribute additional network implementations. Please make PRs with your contributions if you feel they would be helpful to the public.

TODO Add Concentus locally to this project

## Installation
1. TODO

## Information
- Simple
    - Default Unity microphone
    - No user code required and completely self-contained
    - No complicated cloud services required -- everything just works with your existing networking library
- Configurable
    - Settings for...
    - VcAudioSourceOutput settings
        - Audio source
        - Frame lifetime
        - Max negative latency
        - Pitch proportional gain
        - Pitch max correction
    - Exposed Opus settings
        - Application: VOIP, Audio, or Restricted Low-Delay
        - Complexity: 0-10
        - Frame size: 10ms, 20ms, or 40ms
        - Signal: Voice, Music, or Auto
    - TODO Jitter
        - Window size in seconds
        - Default value in seconds
    - Default input is the Unity microphone
    - Default output is a Unity Audio Source
- Functional
    - Functionality and reactive properties with events for
        - Speaking
        - Deafening yourself
        - Input muting yourself
        - Output muting others
    - Unity microphone wrapper
    - Circular audio clip
    - RMS jitter calculation utility within a time window and mean offset window using mean deviation
    - Fixed length array pool utility
    - Serializable reactive property utility
- Modular
    - Abstract VcAudioInput and VcAudioOutput classes
    - Abstract VcInputFilter and VcOutputFilter pipelines
- Testable
    - Echo mode to playback your own voice
    - Sine wave override mode
- Details
    - No memory garbage created at runtime using pooled data buffers
    - Fixed 16kHz sampling frequency
    - Fixed wideband Opus bandwidth
    - Fixed SILK Opus mode
    - Fixed single audio channel
    - Fixed 16-bit audio
    - Fixed 1 second input and output audio clip loop time
    - Average latency is ~(250-300)ms with defaults (Unity's crappy microphone is to blame for ~200ms)
    - Dynamic buffer latency compensation using a latency error P-controller with RMS jitter, sender, and receiver FPS adjustments
- Opus features
    - Variable bitrate encoding
    - Many exposed settings
- TODO FILL IN OTHER FEATURES
- TODO Set default values for everything
- TODO Add tooltips to all settings (Check audio input and output mic and audio sources)

### Planned Features
- Voice activation detection and latching
- Push to talk
- UI for settings and indicators with hooks and an official implementation that saves to PlayerPrefs
- Abstract selection system for configuring voice chat settings for particular clients that the local player wants to configure

## Tutorial
1. TODO
2. Output Audio Source Configuration
    - Place the audio source on the player prefab in the mouth area
    - "Output" = the voice chat audio mixer group
    - "Play On Awake" = false
    - "Loop" is set to true internally, so don't worry
    - "Spacial Blend" = 1 for 3D proximity chat
    - "3D Sound Settings"
        - "Doppler Level" is set to zero internally, so don't worry (it must be zero because of how Unity implements this)
        - "Max Distance" = ~50 meters or whatever you think is best
        - Ensure the volume rolloff curve's last datapoint has a volume of zero

## Tips
- Change Project Settings/Audio/DSP Buffer Size from "Best performance" to "Best latency"
- Chain together input and ouput filters to form pipelines by using the first and next filter fields

## Public APIs
```cs
public class VcMic : IDisposable
{
    public bool IsRecording { get; }
    public AudioClip AudioClip { get; }
    public IReadOnlyList<string> Devices { get; }
    public int CurrentDeviceIndex { get; }
    public int CurrentDeviceName { get; }

    // zero-based frame index, samples
    public event Action<int, float[]> OnFrameReady;

    public void SetDeviceIndex(int index) { }
    public void StartRecording() { }
    public void StopRecording() { }
    public void Dispose() { }
}
```

## Thank Yous

### A massive thank you to [Vatsal Ambastha](https://github.com/adrenak) and his projects [UniVoice](https://github.com/adrenak/univoice) and [UniMic](https://github.com/adrenak/unimic) that were heavily referenced when starting this project in late 2023.

### Another thank you to [Concentus: Opus for Everyone](https://github.com/lostromb/concentus) for their native C# implementation of Opus that makes it extremely easy to add Opus to projects like this.

## Implementations
- [Mirror](https://github.com/MirrorNetworking/Mirror)

## Direct Improvements Over [UniVoice](https://github.com/adrenak/univoice)
- Fixed memory leak
- Many playback algorithm improvements
- Dynamic audio buffer latency compensation
- Lower latency

## Writing Extensions

### How do I write a network implementation?
- TODO

### How do I write a VcAudioInput?
- Ideas: transmit an audio file or in-game audio
- TODO

### How do I write a VcAudioOutput?
- Ideas: save audio or do speech-to-text
- TODO

### How do I write a VcInputFilter?
- TODO

### How do I write a VcOutputFilter?
- TODO

## Community Questions
- Should code fail without throwing exceptions? Should silent failure be an option? E.g. VcMicAudioInput and VcAudioClip may throw.
- How can vulnerabilities be found and compensated for?

# MetaVoiceChat
 
## A simple and self-contained proximity voice chat solution for Unity's popular client-server networking libraries (currently only is Mirror supported*) with all of the features you need.
&ast; Other libraries can easily be implemented by composing an agnostic MonoBehaviour â€” please feel free to contribute additional implementations.

### A massive thank you to [Vatsal Ambastha](https://github.com/adrenak) and his projects [UniVoice](https://github.com/adrenak/univoice) and [UniMic](https://github.com/adrenak/unimic) that were heavily referenced when starting this project in late 2023.

## Installation
TODO

## Features
- No code required
- Many configurable settings
- Voice activation detection and latching
- Pooled data buffers with no runtime allocation
- 16-bit PCM audio
- "ECHO" compilation symbol to playback your own voice when testing
- Functionality and events ([R3](https://github.com/Cysharp/R3) implementation) for
    - Speaking
    - Deafening yourself
    - Input muting yourself
    - Output muting others
- UI settings and indicators with hooks and an official implementation that saves to PlayerPrefs
- Dynamic desync compensation using a latency error P-controller with RMS jitter adjustment

### Planned Features
- Opus audio encoding
- Documentation
- Push to talk

## Implementations
- [Mirror](https://github.com/MirrorNetworking/Mirror)

## Improvements Over [UniVoice](https://github.com/adrenak/univoice)
- Fixed memory leak
